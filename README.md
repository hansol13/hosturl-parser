# hosturl-parser
solution to a coding challenge I was given - keeping in github beacuse this code may prove useful for any future log file analysis.

problem: read in a log file and return each unique hostname and how many times it appears in the log

solution: my solution was to use a map, where the key would be each hostname, and value of each key would be incremented if a hostname already exists in the map
